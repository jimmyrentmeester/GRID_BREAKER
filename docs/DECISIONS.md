# DECISIONS — GRID_BREAKER

Design & tech decisions with rationale. Append new ones; don't rewrite history.

## D1 — Stack: iOS-first SwiftUI (not Compose Multiplatform)
**2026-06-07.** The brief recommends Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin). Overridden in
favor of native SwiftUI because the maintainer's skillset and other projects are
Swift, the budget is €0/solo, and CMP would mean learning a new language+toolchain.
Cross-platform stays possible later (Skip keeps Swift; CMP would be a rewrite) — the
`Core/` spec is kept platform-agnostic so a port reuses it (ground-truth Part 0/4).

## D2 — Brief's commercial framing treated as aspirational
**2026-06-07.** €5k/sprint, €25k cap, 2-person team, ads/IAP, marketing web demo,
backend proxy = AI-generated padding in the brief. Build at real hobby scale; revisit
only on explicit request.

## D3 — Authority is the local client engine
Per brief §10.3 and ground-truth Part 1.1: reflex gameplay can't tolerate network
latency on hit registration, so the device engine is the single source of truth. No
server in the gameplay loop. (A future web build would add a proxy only for high-score
sync — out of scope now.)

## D4 — Deterministic mechanics, seeded-procedural spawns
Mechanical properties + upgrade scaling are hardcoded for fairness/repeatability;
spawn position & type use a difficulty-seeded PRNG (brief §10.3). A seed → identical
replay, which enables free deterministic QA later (ground-truth Part 5.1).

## D5 — Firewall bombs explode only on touch
Natural expiry is always safe (brief §10.3 anti-frustration rule). Encoded in
`NodeType.firewallBomb` (requiredTaps 0, not harvestable).

## D6 — Hand-authored pbxproj
Mirrors the maintainer's PeuterGames convention (explicit file refs, `GB…` hex ids,
objectVersion 56) rather than file-system-synchronized groups, for predictable diffs.
